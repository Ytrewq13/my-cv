\section{Interests}
\subsection{Learning Mandarin Chinese \hfill 2018-11 -- present}
I am very interested in the Chinese language, as well as the history and
culture of China. I started learning using the Duolingo app, and I took 2
10-credit modules in my final year  at Nottingham. I still use Duolingo to
practice every day.

\subsection{Computer programming}
In my spare time I like to write software. While at university, I contributed
to an open source image viewer project which I use, adding support for an
additional image format. I have also programmed several toy projects which
demonstrate technical concepts, including a Mandelbrot Set viewer using a
thread-pool and supporting high-precision zooming.

\subsection{Photography}
I enjoy taking pictures of people, places, and things. I don't publish any of
my photos, but I like taking them to look back on document and look back on the
places I've been.
